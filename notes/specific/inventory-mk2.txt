Alright, so this inventory draws inspiration from subnautica, pokemon mystery dungeon, and motherload, among others.

Some main points:
	- inventory is a grid space. Or whatever works..?
	- items have both a size/shape and weight
	- you can only carry what is realistic, any more requires a bag of some sort.
	- bags come in different sizes, allowing you to hold more
	- the amount you can hold depends on your strength as well as bag size (weight and size both matter). Maxing weight may result in slower movement, and/or faster stamina drain.
	- you can put bags in bags; it will use the space and weight of its items plus itself.
	- inventory UI will have the bag type in the background.
	
now, about item drops:
	- items drop on a grid.
	- if more than a couple items are dropped in the same spot, it becomes a chest; or, perhaps there simply can't be that many items in one spot, and a chest is required to do so... or, items can be in a spot, you just can't look through them easily without a chest.
	- perhaps items can go on solid tiles...? You can pick up what is in front of you..?


Starting out...
	- you start out with a pocket, which can hold a few items like a couple sticks and rocks.
	- prev: the first form of bag is a box, which is unwieldly and requires you to put it down before putting anything else in it.
	- any better than that requires you to find a sheep and get wool from it, and make a loom using logs.
	- or... you pick up a rock, and go over to a log, and smack it. When smacking a log, you can choose to break it into number of things, such as sticks (you can only make sticks with a rock). Using the sticks and other rocks, you can make a crude axe, which allows you to make wood planks from the log instead. These planks...
	
	Naw, I guess that's a *little* too complex. How about, you get sticks from the tree, and a stick plus some stone or other will get you a tool (craftable in personal menu). That is item crafting. There is also tile crafting, which is how you make a loom and other pieces of furniture, and walls and such.
	
Just so we're clear after all the brainstorming, trees will slowly disintegrate into sticks (if broken by hand) or planks (if cut with wood cutting tools such as an axe). Planks can be broken into sticks if desired, though I'm not sure how.
	

note, items need an enum too, though it will function quite different from the TileType enum.
Or... maybe I need to broaden my idea of "item"?
