ok, so there are going to be client and server commands... right..?
I mean, technically, I suppose, all commands should be specified for both client and server, but the behavior cannot exist for both.

How about the behavior just exist totally on the server? That sounds good. Maybe I don't even need to define them for the client; they will just be sent over as... a new packet type, CommandList or something. Then a Command class will hold a string that, when sent by a client, holds the line of text that was entered, and when sent back by a server, indicates a string to be printed to the chat stream.
