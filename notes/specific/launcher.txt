the launcher will be responsible for handling mods to the game, and also making sure you have the latest version of miniventure.
One important feature of it is that it compiles the game code itself; it has to do this because the mod code will reference API classes from the core src (it will also allow usage of libGDX functions, classes, etc). It will go like this:

	- download the latest version of the code, if different from the current download (you can choose if you want to use the lastest version, and if it should update to pre-releases. Or, you can choose a specific version... or it you want to be really specific, you can enter a commit hash).
	
	- display mods in mod folder (button to open mod folder with system-dependent file manager), and which are installed. Also shows any conflicts with the objects each mod defines. FOR NOW: only one mod at a time.
	
	- button to play the game; this compiles the installed mods along with the specified version of the miniventure source code, and the textures, all into one jar file, using gradle. Then, it runs the jar file. Preferably, it monitors it for exceptions, and displays them afterward if they occur (and sends a crash report).
	
	- there's an option to keep the launcher open, or close the window upon launch.
	

Note on how mod data is stored: mods are in a folder dedicated to mods, customizable by the user. each mod consists of a folder (with the name of the mod), and inside the folder, there are 3 things:
	- version.txt, auto-generated, that specifies the last version of miniventure that the mod was compiled with. This is so that it doesn't have to be compiled every time the game runs, only when there is a change to either the miniventure code, or anything else in the mod folder including the assets and code.
	- assets folder, housing all the sprites
	- a "modpack" folder, in which the .java files of the mod reside, including a Mod.java file which will be called from the main game code to fetch all the objects from the mod.

Again, for now, only one mod may be installed at any one time. That means, any mod will have to start with the default modpack.
