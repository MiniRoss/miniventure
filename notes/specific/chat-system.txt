New plan. A seperate chat window off to the side, that can be hidden if desired.

new messages will not be shown except in the chat window when open. 




so... I nned to improve the chat system.

We'll need a way to keep track of all the messages that have appeared, and be able to scroll through them.
The chat area will track up to 50 messages. The length of each message doesn't matter. Messages can contain newlines and still be considered the same message; though the player will not be capable of entering newlines, only the server.

A message will have a given color.

The message area should overlay translucently over the game screen, and display new messages for a short time being hiding them. Though, they will continue to be tracked.

The chat window will do this by having a passive draw mode, when it is not active, and an active draw mode for when it is actually the active menu.

The "passive" window should still be scrollable if need be; that is,
