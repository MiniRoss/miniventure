next steps, for sure:

- make menus with new menu system, including world creation menu and world loading menu
- actually do saving to and loading from file when loading worlds and world chunks (and entities) in server.
- auto-updater

to-do list

****

Items are... well, not in the best shape. I need to try and make them better.

****

save system.

****

command to kill entities, using the @ entity targeting system
command to give items to a player

****

command tab auto-complete system, that works for parameters, not just command names

****

increase biome sizes, in prep of biome song tracks

****

level system; note that levels will not solely be identified by depth (though the core ones will), levels can also be tied to a portal of sorts, like a house door or something. I just need a way to identify them more easily...

****

make some mobs hurt you, once I get more mob sprites.
