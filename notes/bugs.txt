possible for the requestedAnimations queue to generate a null pointer exception when attempting to poll, for some reason.

using the tp command too much can result in renders with tiles with null level references; to fix, perhaps sync player movement with rendering, or just ignore it for that one cycle.

player jumps back whenever walking into an entity that is moving toward it, when the server is remote. I'm pretty sure this is due to the delay between server updates and the server updating the client. The client thinks it can move somewhere, because the server hasn't had a chance to tell it otherwise, so it tries to move. The server then corrects it, causing the "jump-back".

player position becomes a bit spazzy occasionally, and it takes a little bit for it to go back to normal.

UI doesn't scale right. Whenever the window size changes, I need to remake the UI, and call resize on all the conponents. Or revalidate them somehow.

fix the buffer overflow. I need to find out why it's trying to send so many packets, and/or what packets it's trying to send, and buffer it better. Perhaps it is getting hung up on the numerous chunk load packages..? No, that doesn't make sense, the number of chunks loaded doesn't change... what would be affected when you zoom out..?
