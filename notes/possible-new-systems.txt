why not give the player an animation holding items? Or better, use the item's sprite, and just draw it in the player's hand, in each of the player's positions. It's a possible idea, but I'm skeptical.

limited visibility; you have to explore for an area to be shown, otherwise it's black. Or, stones and stuff block the player's view.
Dither effect around the edges, perhaps.

Make a way to be sure I'm seeing what the server is seeing.
