An integrated tutorial for first-time players. Pops up at key points to tell you how to do certain things. Consists of text being drawn places on screen, maybe some arrows, and highlighted screen areas.

why not give the player an animation holding items? Or better, use the item's sprite, and just draw it in the player's hand, in each of the player's positions. It's a possible idea, but I'm skeptical.

limited visibility; you have to explore for an area to be shown, otherwise it's black. Or, stones and stuff block the player's view.
Dither effect around the edges, perhaps.

spells?

****

lasers as a form of energy transport. Wiring could be a thing too, I suppose.

****

level system; note that levels will not solely be identified by depth (though the core ones will), levels can also be tied to a portal of sorts, like a house door or something. I just need a way to identify them more easily...
Then again, maybe I won't need a level system, if I play my cards right with level gen...

Underwater world / biome: requires scuba suit to access. Can dive under in ocean biomes, and explore. Coral, new enemies, etc.
