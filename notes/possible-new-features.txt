If you try to craft something, and you have multiple, different items which satisfy the requirements, a window will pop up asking you which of the items you want to use.

failed interaction animation - player should show indication of failed interaction.

Add a highlight to whatever the player *will* interact with if the attack or interact keys are pressed. Maybe overlay the sprite with a translucent white color.

backpacks, to allow for extra storage on your person. They function as extra inventory from the exact slot that they are put in. They can also be categorized, so only certain items can be placed inside. It might make sense for this to be represented as a piece if furniture, just so putting it down doesn't have the possibility of it disappearing with all your items, relatively quickly. And btw, having backpacks means chests cannot be stored in your inventory if they have anything in them.
