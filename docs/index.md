#### As of now, miniventure is still very new and doesn't have many features, but it's getting there. Here's a list of the major features it *does* have:

  - Multiplayer functionality, allowing many people to play in the same world. The server can be run without a GUI.
  - Random level generation based on perlin noise...improvements coming soon though!
  - Sprite animations and smooth tile transitions
  - basic tool crafting and interactions
  - an update-checker that tells you when there's a new update available, and gives you the link.
  - sound effects and a little bit of music

If you want to know what some of the current goals are in terms of development, check out the files in [notes/next-projects](https://github.com/chrisj42/miniventure/tree/master/notes/next-projects).


Note: for those goals about adding stuff, it's sort of dependent on whether I have any art to depict said stuff... and I suck at art. :P So, if anyone out there is interested in making some sprites for the game, it would be greatly apprecieated. :D

You can find me on the [playminicraft discord server](https://discord.me/minicraft) pretty much daily, as Chris J. There's some other mods of minicraft there too, and a couple other active modders; or you can take a look at the official [playminicraft website](https://playminicraft.com).
