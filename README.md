# miniventure
A remake of minicraft plus. After learning a bunch from the project, I wanted to start fresh, and try to make the best game possible. Let's see how it goes!

As of now, miniventure is still very new and doesn't have many features, but it's getting there. Here's a list of the major features it *does* have:

  - Multiplayer functionality, allowing many people to play in the same world. The server can be run without a GUI.
  - Random level generation based on perlin noise
  - Sprite animations and smooth tile transitions
  - basic tool crafting and interactions
  
Current goals include:
  - Adding more mobs
  - Adding more tiles
  - Adding more items
  - Making a level system

Note: for those goals about adding stuff, it's sort of dependent on whether I have any art to depict said stuff... and I suck at art. :P So, if anyone out there is interested in making some sprites for the game, it would be greatly apprecieated. :D

You can find me on the [playminicraft discord server](https://discord.me/minicraft) pretty much daily, as Chris J. There's some other mods of minicraft there too, and a couple other active modders; or you can take a look at the official [playminicraft website](https://playminicraft.com).
